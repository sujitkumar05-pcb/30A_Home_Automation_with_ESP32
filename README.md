# 30A_Home_Automation_with_ESP32

1. Project Overview

30A Home Automation with ESP32 is a high-power IoT control system designed to safely switch electrical loads up to 30A. It uses the ESP32 for Wi-Fi–based remote control and automation. The complete schematic, PCB layout, and 3D design were developed in KiCad, with a strong focus on electrical isolation, proper track width, and safety for real-world applications.
